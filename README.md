# Mtihani

Mtihani Revise is an app that will enable High School goers in Kenya sitting for the Kenya National Examinations KCSE certificate at the end of  four years to prepare adequately by giving them free and reliable access to all the past KCSE Exam papers from 2000 to 2018. This will help them in revision and also in giving them cheaper access to these materials as they are expensively sold in bookshops.
